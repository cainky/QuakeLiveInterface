## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you find a vulnerability in the project, please follow the steps below:

1. Do not open an issue on the GitHub repository. Disclosing the vulnerability publicly before we've had a chance to address it may put users of the project at risk.
2. Instead, please send a direct message to the project maintainers.
3. Provide as much information as you can about the vulnerability. The more information you can provide, the easier it will be for us to respond effectively.
4. Please do not disclose the vulnerability to anyone else until we've had a chance to address it.

Upon receiving your message, we'll respond as quickly as possible to confirm receipt and to discuss next steps. We appreciate your help in keeping our project and its users secure!
